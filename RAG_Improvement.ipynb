            "[{'generated_text': 'What are the advantages and disadvantages of selective breeding in fish farming?\\n\\nAdvantages: Selective breeding is a process that can be used to improve the quality of fish. It can also help to increase the number of fish that are produced. Disadvantages: Selective breeding can lead to the loss of genetic diversity, which can make it difficult for fish to adapt to changing conditions.\\n\\n## How do you breed fish?\\n\\nThere are many ways to breed fish. One way is to put two fish together in a tank and hope they will mate. Another way is to use a hormone called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) to stimulate the fish’s reproductive system. GnRH is available as an injection or implant.\\n\\n## Can you breed fish with different species?\\n\\nYes, you can breed fish with different species. However, there are some things to keep in mind when doing so. First, make sure that the fish are compatible. Second, be aware of the potential risks involved. Finally, be prepared to take care of the offspring.\\n\\n## Is it possible to breed fish with different colors?\\n\\nIt is possible to breed fish with different colors, but it is not always easy. Some fish have more than one color gene, so it can be difficult to get them to breed true. In addition, some fish may only produce offspring of one color, even if they are bred with another color fish.\\n\\n## How do you breed fish with different genes?\\n\\nThere are a few ways to breed fish with different genes. One way is to crossbreed two different types of fish. This can create new and unique fish that have traits from both parents. Another way is to use artificial selection, where you choose specific fish based on their genes and then breed them together. This can create new and improved fish that have the best traits from both parents.\\n\\n## How do you breed fish with different sizes?\\n\\nThere are a few ways to breed fish with different sizes. One way is to use a technique called “selective breeding.” This involves choosing fish that are the size you want and then breeding them together. Another way is to use a technique called “crossbreeding.” This involves crossing two different types of fish together. The resulting offspring will be a mix of the two parent fish.\\n\\n## How do you breed fish with different colors?\\n\\nThere are a few ways to breed fish'}]\n",

              "'\\n\\nAdvantages: Selective breeding is a process that can be used to improve the quality of fish. It can also help to increase the number of fish that are produced. Disadvantages: Selective breeding can lead to the loss of genetic diversity, which can make it difficult for fish to adapt to changing conditions.\\n\\n## How do you breed fish?\\n\\nThere are many ways to breed fish. One way is to put two fish together in a tank and hope they will mate. Another way is to use a hormone called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) to stimulate the fish’s reproductive system. GnRH is available as an injection or implant.\\n\\n## Can you breed fish with different species?\\n\\nYes, you can breed fish with different species. However, there are some things to keep in mind when doing so. First, make sure that the fish are compatible. Second, be aware of the potential risks involved. Finally, be prepared to take care of the offspring.\\n\\n## Is it possible to breed fish with different colors?\\n\\nIt is possible to breed fish with different colors, but it is not always easy. Some fish have more than one color gene, so it can be difficult to get them to breed true. In addition, some fish may only produce offspring of one color, even if they are bred with another color fish.\\n\\n## How do you breed fish with different genes?\\n\\nThere are a few ways to breed fish with different genes. One way is to crossbreed two different types of fish. This can create new and unique fish that have traits from both parents. Another way is to use artificial selection, where you choose specific fish based on their genes and then breed them together. This can create new and improved fish that have the best traits from both parents.\\n\\n## How do you breed fish with different sizes?\\n\\nThere are a few ways to breed fish with different sizes. One way is to use a technique called “selective breeding.” This involves choosing fish that are the size you want and then breeding them together. Another way is to use a technique called “crossbreeding.” This involves crossing two different types of fish together. The resulting offspring will be a mix of the two parent fish.\\n\\n## How do you breed fish with different colors?\\n\\nThere are a few ways to breed fish'"

However, interfaces between both 3GPP and 3GPP2 functional entities are described in this specification.\\n\\nSRVCC from E-UTRAN access to 3GPP2 1xCS is covered in this specification, including the handling of IMS emergency call continuity. Handling of non-voice component and SRVCC from 3GPP2 1xCS to E-UTRAN direction is not specified in this release.\\n\\nSRVCC from NG-RAN/E-UTRAN/UTRAN (HSPA) access and 3GPP UTRAN/GERAN CS accesses for voice calls that are anchored in the IMS, as well as the coordination between the SRVCC for voice call and the handover of non-voice PS bearers are covered in this specification. SRVCC with IMS emergency call continuity from E-UTRAN/UTRAN (HSPA) to 3GPP UTRAN/GERAN CS accesses and from NG-RAN to UTRAN for voice calls is covered in this specification. SRVCC with eCall over IMS continuity from E-UTRAN/UTRAN (HSPA) to 3GPP UTRAN/GERAN CS accesses is covered in this specification. SRVCC with priority handling from E-UTRAN to 3GPP UTRAN/GERAN CS accesses for voice or voice and video calls is also covered in this specification. The handover of non-voice PS bearer from E-UTRAN is specified by the procedures defined in TS\\xa023.401\\xa0[2], TS\\xa023.060\\xa0[10], TS\\xa025.413\\xa0[11] and TS\\xa043.129\\xa0[12].

Only associated voice and/or video media may get transferred to UTRAN.\\n\\n4.2\\tConcepts\\n\\n4.2.1\\tE-UTRAN to 3GPP2 1xCS SRVCC\\n\\nFor SRVCC-capable UEs, the call is always anchored at the VCC AS in the 3GPP2\\'s IMS. The 3GPP2 1xCS IWS enables a single radio UE to communicate in parallel both with the source system and the target system. From VCC perspective, this mechanism minimizes the voice gap by supporting the transport of signalling for establishment of the target CS access leg while the terminal is connected to the source PS access network.\\n\\nFigure 4.2.1-1: Transport of 3GPP2 1xCS signalling messages for preparation of the CS access leg in the target system\\n\\nThe S102 reference point is used to convey 3GPP2 1xCS signalling messages between the MME and 3GPP2 1xCS IWS. These 1x CS signalling messages are actually exchanged between the UE and the 3GPP2 1xCS IWS, and S102 is only one link in the overall UE-1xCS IWS tunnelling path. On the remaining portion of the tunnelling path, the 3GPP2 1xCS signalling messages are encapsulated in E-UTRAN/EPS tunnelling messages (UE-MME).\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2.2\\tE-UTRAN to 3GPP UTRAN/GERAN SRVCC\\n\\nFor facilitating session transfer (SRVCC) of the voice component to the CS domain, the IMS multimedia telephony sessions needs to be anchored in the IMS.\\n\\nFor SRVCC from E-UTRAN to UTRAN/GERAN, MME first receives the handover request from E-UTRAN with the indication that this is for SRVCC handling, and then triggers the SRVCC procedure with the MSC Server enhanced for SRVCC via the Sv reference point if MME has STN-SR information for this UE. If SRVCC with priority is supported, based on the ARP associated with the EPS bearer used for IMS signalling, the MME sets the priority indication appropriately toward the MSC Server. MME aware of which EPS bearer is used for IMS signalling based on local configuration. MSC Server enhanced for SRVCC then initiates the session transfer procedure to IMS and coordinates it with the CS handover procedure to the target cell. If SRVCC with priority is supported, IMS session transfer procedure and the CS handover procedure are performed with priority handling per the priority indication received from MME. MSC Server enhanced for SRVCC then sends PS-CS handover Response to MME, which includes the necessary CS HO command information for the UE to access the UTRAN/GERAN.\\n\\nHandling of any non-voice PS bearer is done by the PS bearer splitting function in the MME. MME starts the handover of non-voice PS bearer during SRVCC procedure based on the information received from E-UTRAN. The handover of non-voice PS bearer(s), if performed, is done as according to Inter RAT handover procedure as defined in TS\\xa023.401\\xa0[2]. The MME is responsible to coordinate the Forward Relocation Response from PS-PS handover procedure and the SRVCC PS to CS Response.\\n\\nNOTE:\\tDepending on operator\\'s policy, when 5GS is deployed, the eNB can switch the PS HO off when it initiates SRVCC procedure, i.e. SRVCC only for CS voice.\\n\\nFigure 4.2.2-1: Overall high level concepts for SRVCC from E-UTRAN to UTRAN/GERAN\\n\\n4.2.2a\\tE-UTRAN to 3GPP UTRAN vSRVCC\\n\\nFor facilitating session transfer of the voice and video components to the CS domain, the IMS multimedia telephony sessions needs to be anchored in the IMS.\\n\\nFor vSRVCC, the UE uses one voice and one video media component over the associated QCI=1 and vSRVCC marked PS bearers for bearer identification reasons. The MME first receives the handover request from E-UTRAN. It then triggers the vSRVCC procedure with the MSC Server enhanced for vSRVCC via the Sv reference point with vSRVCC related information. MSC Server enhanced for vSRVCC then interacts with IMS and initiates the session transfer procedure to IMS and coordinates it with the CS handover procedure to the target cell. If SRVCC with priority is supported, IMS session transfer procedure and the CS handover procedure are performed with priority handling according to the priority indication received from MME.\\n\\n\\n\\nMSC Server performs SRVCC procedure if the current active session is voice only. MSC Server enhanced for vSRVCC then sends PS-CS Handover Response to MME, which includes the necessary CS HO command information for the UE to access the UTRAN. If the target cell is GERAN, MME only triggers SRVCC (i.e. only the voice component of the Video Call is transferred using the SRVCC procedure).\\n\\nIf SCC AS indicates current active session is voice and video, the MSC Server requests UTRAN radio resources for BS30 bearer and continues with the vSRVCC procedure. The BS30 bearer is a 64\\xa0kbps bearer for multimedia as defined in clause\\xa03.1.2.13 of TS\\xa022.002\\xa0[38].If the BS30 bearer reservation was unsuccessful, then vSRVCC procedure is considered failed and appropriate rejection cause is given back to E-UTRAN.\\n\\nHandling of any non QCI=1 and vSRVCC marked PS bearer is done by the PS bearer splitting function in the MME. MME starts the handover of non QCI=1 and vSRVCC marked PS bearer during vSRVCC procedure based on the information received from E-UTRAN. The handover of non QCI=1 and vSRVCC marked PS bearer(s), if performed, is done as according to Inter RAT handover procedure, as defined in TS\\xa023.401\\xa0[2]. The MME is responsible to coordinate the Forward Relocation Response from PS-PS handover procedure and the vSRVCC PS to CS Response.\\n\\nWhen the UE receives the HO Command indicating a TS\\xa011 or BS30 bearer, it knows whether it should start the CS\\xa03G-324M video codec negotiation or SRVCC.\\n\\nFigure 4.2.2a-1: Overall high level concepts for vSRVCC from E-UTRAN to UTRAN\\n\\n4.2.3\\tUTRAN (HSPA) to 3GPP UTRAN/GERAN SRVCC\\n\\nFor facilitating session transfer (SRVCC) of the voice component to the CS domain, the IMS multimedia telephony sessions needs to be anchored in the IMS.\\n\\nFor SRVCC from UTRAN (HSPA) to UTRAN/GERAN, SGSN first receives the handover request from UTRAN (HSPA) with the indication that this is for SRVCC handling, and then triggers the SRVCC procedure with the MSC Server enhanced for SRVCC via the Sv if SGSN has STN-SR information for this UE. MSC Server enhanced for SRVCC then initiates the session transfer procedure to IMS and coordinates it with the CS handover procedure to the target cell. MSC Server enhanced for SRVCC then sends PS-CS handover Response to SGSN, which includes the necessary CS HO command information for the UE to access the UTRAN/GERAN.\\n\\nHandling of any non-voice PS bearer is done by the PS bearer splitting function in the SGSN. SGSN starts the handover of non-voice PS bearer during SRVCC procedure based on the information received from UTRAN (HSPA). The handover of non-voice PS bearer(s), if performed, is done as according to Inter/Intra RAT handover procedure as defined in TS\\xa023.060\\xa0[10] and TS\\xa025.413\\xa0[11]. The SGSN is responsible to coordinate the Forward Relocation Response from PS-PS handover procedure and the SRVCC PS to CS Response.\\n\\nFigure 4.2.3-1: Overall high level concepts for SRVCC from UTRAN (HSPA) to UTRAN/GERAN\\n\\n4.2.4\\tSRVCC for IMS emergency sessions\\n\\n4.2.4.1\\tE-UTRAN/UTRAN (HSPA) to 3GPP UTRAN/GERAN\\n\\nUE initiates the IMS emergency session as specified in TS\\xa023.167\\xa0[28], TS\\xa023.401\\xa0[2] for E-UTRAN or TS\\xa023.060\\xa0[10] for UTRAN (HSPA). For facilitating session transfer (SRVCC) of the IMS emergency session to the CS domain, the IMS emergency session needs to be anchored in the serving IMS (i.e., in visited PLMN when roaming) as specified in TS\\xa023.237\\xa0[14].\\n\\nThe E-UTRAN initiates the SRVCC procedure as specified for regular Voice over IMS session.\\n\\nSRVCC for IMS emergency session can be supported regardless of the subscription data from the HPLMN. If the MME detects IMS emergency session event (e.g., emergency APN and associated QCI-1 bearer setup), MME shall update the E-UTRAN that SRVCC is possible by including \"SRVCC operation possible\" indication via S1 AP UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST, if needed.\\n\\nAfter IMS emergency session is released, MME shall restore the SRVCC indication to the same status as prior to the emergency session was established. If needed, reverting SRVCC indication to \"not possible\" is performed by including \"SRVCC operation not possible\" indication via S1 AP UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST. This allows the MME to update E-UTRAN to invoke SRVCC for emergency session while the SRVCC is not allowed for normal IMS voice session due to subscription data from the HPLMN (i.e., No STN-SR and C-MSISDN received from the subscription data are not considered by the serving MME (e.g. HSS).\\n\\nThe MME is aware that this is an emergency session and sends an indication to the MSC Server enhanced for SRVCC. MSC Server then initiates the IMS service continuity procedure with the locally configured E-STN-SR to the serving IMS. When handover of the emergency session has been completed, the MME/SGSN or the MSC Server may initiate location continuity procedures for the UE as defined in TS\\xa023.271\\xa0[29].\\n\\nFigure 4.2.4.1-1: Overall high level concepts for SRVCC IMS emergency session with E-STN-SR\\n\\n4.2.4.2\\tE-UTRAN to 3GPP2 1xCS\\n\\nThe UE initiates emergency session over E-UTRAN as specified in TS\\xa023.167\\xa0[28], TS\\xa023.401\\xa0[2], upon detecting handover is required from E-UTRAN to CDMA 1x, the SRVCC emergency procedure apply. To support handover of emergency session the network is aware that the UE and core network support SRVCC and has information to identify Emergency session.

The support is exactly the same as for handover of the voice channel of an IMS emergency call from E-UTRAN/UTRAN (HSPA) to 3GPP UTRAN/GERAN with the addition of continuing support for transfer of updated MSD from the UE to an emergency centre/PSAP by in-band means.\\n\\nNOTE:\\tAn eCall over IMS can only be originated on E-UTRAN but for a UE not in eCall Only mode, handover from E-UTRAN to UTRAN (HSPA) is possible, thence leading to a possible handover to GERAN/UTRAN in the CS domain.\\n\\n4.2.5\\tVoid\\n\\n4.2.6\\tCS to PS SRVCC\\n\\nFor facilitating session transfer (SRVCC) of the voice component from the CS domain, the voice session shall be anchored in the IMS.\\n\\nFigure 4.2.6-1: UTRAN/GERAN to E-UTRAN/UTRAN(HSPA)\\n\\nThe UE informs the MSC Server about the MME/SGSN the UE had last contact with using P-TMSI+RAI+P-TMSI signature or GUTI upon MSC request. For CS to PS SRVCC, MSC Server first receives the handover request from UTRAN/GERAN with the indication that this is for CS to PS SRVCC handling and then triggers the CS to PS SRVCC procedure with the target MME/SGSN enhanced with CS to PS SRVCC via the enhanced Sv reference point. The MME \\n\\n\\n\\nenhanced with CS to PS SRVCC triggers PS HO in target E-UTRAN/UTRAN (HSPA). If the target MME/SGSN does not have the UE context then the target MME/SGSN retrieves the UE context from the source SGSN/MME.\\n\\nMSC Server then initiates the session transfer procedure to IMS and coordinates it with the PS handover procedure to the target cell. MME then sends CS-PS handover Response to MSC Server, which includes the necessary CS to PS HO command information for the UE to access the E-UTRAN/UTRAN (HSPA).\\n\\n4.2.7\\tNG-RAN to 3GPP UTRAN 5G-SRVCC\\n\\n4.2.7.1\\tGeneral\\n\\nService continuity to UTRAN is supported only for the voice component of an IMS Session or IMS Emergency Session and only when both the UE and the network support 5G-SRVCC.\\n\\nFor facilitating session transfer (SRVCC) of the voice component to the CS domain, the IMS multimedia telephony sessions needs to be anchored in the IMS.\\n\\nFor 5G-SRVCC from NG-RAN to UTRAN, AMF first receives the handover request from NG-RAN with the indication that this is for 5G-SRVCC handling, and then AMF sends the forward relocation request with 5G-SRVCC HO Indication to MME_SRVCC together with STN-SR and C-MSISDN. This MME_SRVCC then triggers the SRVCC procedure with the MSC Server enhanced for SRVCC via the Sv reference point. AMF is aware of which PDU session is used for IMS session based on the DNN. The MSC Server enhanced for SRVCC then initiates the session transfer procedure to IMS and coordinates it with the CS handover procedure to the target cell (as in other SRVCC cases). MSC Server enhanced for SRVCC then sends PS-CS handover Response to MME_SRVCC, which includes the necessary CS HO command information for the UE to access the UTRAN. MME_SRVCC sends the forward relocation response message including this information to AMF. AMF sends the Handover Command to NG-RAN and NG-RAN sends the Handover Command to UE.\\n\\nAfter UE moves to UTRAN and AMF receives the forward relocation complete, AMF requests PDU session release for all the PDU session.\\n\\nFigure 4.2.7-1: Overall high level concepts for 5G-SRVCC from NG-RAN to UTRAN\\n\\nThis specification introduces an additional function to those defined in the 5GC architecture in TS\\xa023.501\\xa0[48] for 5G-SRVCC.

The S1 messages that transfer the \"SRVCC operation possible\" to the eNodeB are specified in TS\\xa036.413\\xa0[30].\\n\\n6.2.1C\\tDedicated Bearer Establishment and Modification procedures for vSRVCC\\n\\nDedicated Bearer Establishment and Modification procedures for a session for which vSRVCC is allowed are performed as defined in TS\\xa023.401\\xa0[2] with the following additions:\\n\\nIf dynamic PCC is deployed, the PCRF in the serving PLMN (i.e., VPLMN if roaming) interacts with the P-GW or S-GW as defined in TS\\xa023.203\\xa0[32].

The flow requires that eNB can determine that the target is GERAN without DTM support or that the UE is without DTM support.\\n\\nFigure 6.2.2.1-1: SRVCC from E-UTRAN to GERAN without DTM support\\n\\n1.\\tUE sends measurement reports to E-UTRAN.\\n\\n2.\\tBased on UE measurement reports the source E-UTRAN decides to trigger an SRVCC handover to GERAN.\\n\\n3.\\tSource E-UTRAN sends Handover Required (Target ID, generic Source to Target Transparent Container, SRVCC HO Indication) message to the source MME. The E-UTRAN places the \"old BSS to new BSS information IE\" for the CS domain in the generic Source to Target Transparent Container. The SRVCC HO indication indicates to the MME that target is only CS capable, hence this is a SRVCC handover operation only towards the CS domain. The message includes an indication that the UE is not available for the PS service in the target cell.\\n\\n4.\\tBased on the QCI associated with the voice bearer (QCI 1) and the SRVCC HO indication, the source MME splits the voice bearer from the non-voice bearers and initiates the PS-CS handover procedure for the voice bearer only towards MSC Server.\\n\\n5.\\tThe MME sends a SRVCC PS to CS Request (IMSI, Target ID, STN-SR, C-MSISDN, generic Source to Target Transparent Container, MM Context, Emergency Indication) message to the MSC Server. If SRVCC with priority is supported, the MME also includes priority indication in SRVCC PS to CS Request if it detects the SRVCC requires priority handling. The detection is based on the ARP associated with the EPS bearer used for IMS signalling. The priority indication corresponds to the ARP information element. The Emergency Indication \\n\\n\\n\\nand the equipment identifier are included if the ongoing session is emergency session. Authenticated IMSI and C-MSISDN shall also be included, if available. The MME received STN-SR and C-MSISDN from the HSS as part of the subscription profile downloaded during the E-UTRAN attach procedure. The MM Context contains security related information. CS security key is derived by the MME from the E-UTRAN/EPS domain key as defined in TS\\xa033.401\\xa0[22]. The CS Security key is sent in the MM Context.\\n\\n6.\\tThe MSC Server interworks the PS-CS handover request with a CS inter-MSC handover request by sending a Prepare Handover Request message to the target MSC. If SRVCC with priority is supported, and the MSC Server receives the priority indication (i.e. ARP) in the SRVCC PS to CS Request, the MSC server/MGW sends Prepare Handover Request message to the Target MSC with priority indication mapped from the ARP. The MSC Server maps the ARP to the priority level, pre-emption capability/vulnerability for CS services based on local regulation or operator settings. The priority indication indicates the CS call priority during handover as specified in TS\\xa048.008\\xa0[23] for GSM/EDGE. The MSC Server assigns a default SAI as Source ID on the interface to the target BSS and uses BSSMAP encapsulated for the Prepare Handover Request.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa01:\\tThe value of the default SAI is configured in the MSC and allows a release 8 and later BSC to identify that the source for the SRVCC Handover is E-UTRAN. To ensure correct statistics in the target BSS the default SAI should be different from the SAIs used in UTRAN.\\n\\n7.\\tTarget MSC performs resource allocation with the target BSS by exchanging Handover Request/ Acknowledge messages. If the MSC Server indicated priority, the target BSS allocates the radio resource based on the existing procedures with priority indication, as specified in TS\\xa023.009\\xa0[18] and in TS\\xa048.008\\xa0[23] for GSM/EDGE.\\n\\n8.\\tTarget MSC sends a Prepare Handover Response message to the MSC Server.\\n\\n9.\\tEstablishment of circuit connection between the target MSC and the MGW associated with the MSC Server e.g. using ISUP IAM and ACM messages.\\n\\n10.\\tFor non-emergency session, the MSC Server initiates the Session Transfer by using the STN-SR e.g. by sending an ISUP IAM (STN-SR) message towards the IMS. If this is a priority session, the MSC Server includes priority indication to the IMS and the IMS entity handles the session transfer procedure with priority. The priority indication in the Session Transfer is mapped by the MSC Server from the priority indication (i.e. ARP) in the SRVCC PS to CS Request received in step\\xa05. The mapping of the priority level is based on operator policy and/or local configuration, and the IMS priority indicator should be the same as for the original IMS created over PS. For emergency session, the MSC Server initiates the Session Transfer by using the locally configured E-STN-SR and by including the equipment identifier. IMS Service Continuity or Emergency IMS Service Continuity procedures are applied for execution of the Session Transfer, see TS\\xa023.237\\xa0[14].\\n\\nNOTE\\xa02:\\tThis step can be started after step\\xa08.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa03:\\tIf the MSC Server is using an ISUP interface, then the initiation of the session transfer for non-emergency session may fail if the subscriber profile including CAMEL triggers is not available prior handover (see clause\\xa07.3.2.1.3 in TS\\xa023.292\\xa0[13]), and can also fail if CAMEL triggers are available and local anchor transfer function is used (see TS\\xa023.237\\xa0[14]). If the subscriber profile is available prior handover then CAMEL triggers others than those used in clause\\xa07.3.2.1.3 of TS\\xa023.292\\xa0[13] are not used during the transfer.\\n\\n11.\\tDuring the execution of the Session Transfer procedure the remote end is updated with the SDP of the CS access leg. The downlink flow of VoIP packets is switched towards the CS access leg at this point.\\n\\n12.\\tSource IMS access leg is released as per TS\\xa023.237\\xa0[14].\\n\\nNOTE\\xa04:\\tSteps\\xa011 and 12 are independent of step\\xa013.\\n\\n13.\\tMSC Server sends a SRVCC PS to CS Response (Target to Source Transparent Container) message to the source MME.\\n\\n14.\\tSource MME sends a Handover Command (Target to Source Transparent Container) message to the source E-UTRAN. The message includes information about the voice component only.\\n\\n15.\\tSource E-UTRAN sends a Handover from E-UTRAN Command message to the UE.\\n\\n15a.\\tIf the PLMN has configured Secondary RAT usage data reporting and the source eNodeB has Secondary RAT usage data to report, the reporting is performed as specified in TS\\xa023.401\\xa0[2].\\n\\n\\n\\n16.\\tUE tunes to GERAN.\\n\\n17.\\tHandover Detection at the target BSS occurs, then the target BSS sends Handover Detection message to the target MSC. At this stage, the target MSC can send/receive voice data. The UE sends a Handover Complete message via the target BSS to the target MSC. If the target MSC is not the MSC Server, then the Target MSC sends an SES (Handover Complete) message to the MSC Server.\\n\\n18.\\tThe UE starts the Suspend procedure specified in TS\\xa023.060\\xa0[10], clause\\xa016.2.1.1.2. The TLLI and RAI pair are derived from the GUTI as described in TS\\xa023.003\\xa0[27]. This triggers the Target SGSN to send a Suspend Notification message to the Source MME. The MME returns a Suspend Acknowledge to the Target SGSN.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa05:\\tThis step\\xa0may take place in parallel with steps 19-22.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa06:\\tThe MME might not be able to derive the GUTI from the received P-TMSI and RAI pair and therefore it might not be able to identify which UE context is associated with the Suspend Notification message. Also in this case the bearers are deactivated and/or suspended as in step\\xa022a.\\n\\n19.\\tTarget BSS sends a Handover Complete message to the target MSC.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa07:\\tThis step\\xa0may take place immediately after Handover Detection at the target BSS occurs in step\\xa017, before the BSS has received a Suspend message from the UE.\\n\\n20.\\tTarget MSC sends an SES (Handover Complete) message to the MSC Server. The speech circuit is through connected in the MSC Server/MGW according to TS\\xa023.009\\xa0[18].\\n\\n21.\\tCompletion of the establishment procedure with ISUP Answer message to the MSC Server according to TS\\xa023.009\\xa0[18].\\n\\n22.\\tMSC Server sends a SRVCC PS to CS Complete Notification message to the source MME, informing it that the UE has arrived on the target side. Source MME acknowledges the information by sending a SRVCC PS to CS Complete Acknowledge message to the MSC Server.\\n\\n22a.\\tThe MME deactivates bearers used for voice and other GBR bearers. All GBR bearers are deactivated towards S-GW and P-GW by initiating MME-initiated Dedicated Bearer Deactivation procedure as specified in TS\\xa023.401\\xa0[2]. PS-to-CS handover indicator is notified to P-GW for voice bearer during the bearer deactivation procedure. For GTP-based S5/S8, the S-GW requests the P-GW to delete all GBR bearer contexts by sending a Delete Bearer Command message. If dynamic PCC is deployed, the P-GW may interact with PCRF as defined in TS\\xa023.203\\xa0[32]. For PMIP-based S5/S8, S-GW interacts with the PCRF which in turn updates PCC rules for GBR traffic in the P-GW.\\n\\n\\tThe MME starts preservation and suspension of non-GBR bearers by sending Suspend Notification message towards S-GW. For these non-GBR bearers, the S-GW releases S1-U bearers for the UE and sends Suspend Notification message to the P-GW(s). The MME stores in the UE context that UE is in suspended status. All the preserved non-GBR bearers are marked as suspended status in the S-GW and P-GW. The P-GW should discard packets if received for the suspended UE.\\n\\n22b.\\tThe source MME requests the release of the resources, including release of the S1 signalling connection, to the Source eNodeB. The Source eNodeB releases its resources related to the UE and responds back to the MME.\\n\\n23a.\\tFor non-emergency sessions and if the HLR is to be updated, i.e. if the IMSI is authenticated but unknown in the VLR, the MSC Server performs a TMSI reallocation towards the UE using its own non-broadcast LAI and, if the MSC Server and other MSC/VLRs serve the same (target) LAI, with its own Network Resource Identifier (NRI).\\n\\nNOTE\\xa08:\\tThe TMSI reallocation is performed by the MSC Server towards the UE via target MSC.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa09:\\tFor emergency services sessions the HLR will not be updated. TMSI reallocation may be performed based on IMSI presence.\\n\\n23b.\\tFor non-emergency sessions and if the MSC Server performed a TMSI reallocation in step\\xa023a, and if this TMSI reallocation was completed successfully, the MSC Server performs a MAP Update Location to the HSS/HLR.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa010:\\tThis Update Location is not initiated by the UE.\\n\\n\\n\\n24.\\tFor an emergency services session after handover is complete, the source MME or the MSC Server may send a Subscriber Location Report carrying the identity of the MSC Server to a GMLC associated with the source or target side, respectively, as defined in TS\\xa023.271\\xa0[29] to support location continuity.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa011:\\tAny configuration of the choice between a source MME versus MSC Server update to a GMLC needs to ensure that a single update occurs from one of these entities when the control plane location solution is used on the source and/or target sides.\\n\\nAfter the CS voice call is terminated and if the UE is still in GERAN (or for any other reason specified in TS\\xa024.008\\xa0[44]), then the UE shall resume PS services as specified in TS\\xa023.060\\xa0[10]. A Gn SGSN will follow TS\\xa023.060\\xa0[10] to resume the PDP Context(s). An S4-SGSN will follow TS\\xa023.060\\xa0[10] to resume the bearers, and will in addition inform S-GW and P-GW(s) to resume the suspended bearers. If the UE has returned to E-UTRAN after the CS voice call was terminated, then the UE shall resume PS service by sending TAU to MME. The MME will in addition inform S-GW and P-GW(s) to resume the suspended bearers. Resuming the suspended bearers in the S-GW and in the P-GW should be done by implicit resume using the Modify Bearer request message if it is triggered by the procedure in operation, e.g. RAU, TAU or Service Request. The S-GW is aware of the suspend state of the bearers and will forward the Modify Bearer request to the P-GW. Explicit resume using the Resume Notification message should be used in cases when Modify Bearer Request is not triggered by the procedure in operation.\\n\\n6.2.2.1A\\tSRVCC from E-UTRAN to GERAN with DTM but without DTM HO support and from E-UTRAN to UTRAN without PS HO\\n\\nThe call flow for this scenario is similar to the call flow depicted in figure\\xa06.2.2.1-1, with the exceptions that the Suspend procedure (step\\xa018 and step\\xa022a in figure\\xa06.2.2.1-1) is not performed and that the MME only deactivates bearers used for voice (step 22a in figure 6.2.2.1-1) and sets the PS-to-CS handover indicator. The scenario requires that eNB can determine that the target is either GERAN with DTM but without DTM HO support and that the UE is supporting DTM or that the target is UTRAN (HSPA) without PS HO support.\\n\\nNOTE:\\tThe eNB can be configured to use this procedure according to operator\\'s policy when 5GS is deployed.\\n\\nThe message in step\\xa03 in figure\\xa06.2.2.1-1 includes an indication to the MME that the UE is available for PS service in the target cell. Furthermore, if the target is GERAN, the E-UTRAN places in the generic Source to Target Transparent Container the \"old BSS to new BSS information IE\", while if the target is UTRAN, the generic Source to Target Transparent container is encoded according to the Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container IE definition. At the end of the procedure described in figure\\xa06.2.2.1-1, the remaining PS resources are re-established when the UE performs the Routeing Area update procedure. Triggers for performing Routeing Area update procedure are described in TS\\xa023.060\\xa0[10]. The target SGSN may deactivate the PDP contexts that cannot be established as described in TS\\xa023.060\\xa0[10].\\n\\n6.2.2.2\\tSRVCC from E-UTRAN to UTRAN with PS HO or GERAN with DTM HO support\\n\\nDepicted in figure\\xa06.2.2.2-1 is a call flow for SRVCC from E-UTRAN to UTRAN or GERAN with DTM HO support, including the handling of the non-voice component. The flow requires that eNB can determine that either the target is UTRAN with PS HO or the target is GERAN with DTM support and the UE is supporting DTM.\\n\\nFigure 6.2.2.2-1: SRVCC from E-UTRAN to UTRAN with PS HO or GERAN with DTM HO support\\n\\n1.\\tUE sends measurement reports to E-UTRAN.\\n\\n2.\\tBased on UE measurement reports the source E-UTRAN decides to trigger an SRVCC handover to UTRAN/GERAN.\\n\\n3.\\tIf target is UTRAN, the source E-UTRAN sends a Handover Required (Target ID, generic Source to Target Transparent Container, SRVCC HO indication) message to the source MME.

The differentiation between CS and PS containers is described in TS\\xa036.413\\xa0[30]. In this case, the MME identifies from SRVCC HO Indication that this is a request for a CS+PS handover.\\n\\n4.\\tBased on the QCI associated with the voice bearer (QCI 1) and the SRVCC HO Indication, the source MME splits the voice bearer from all other PS bearers and initiates their relocation towards MSC Server and SGSN, respectively.\\n\\n\\n\\n5a)\\tSource MME initiates the PS-CS handover procedure for the voice bearer by sending a SRVCC PS to CS Request (IMSI, Target ID, STN-SR, C-MSISDN, Source to Target Transparent Container, MM Context, Emergency Indication) message to the MSC Server.

After the setup of a dedicated bearer for voice and the respective filters in UE and PGW, the default bearer is not longer used for voice media and the PCRF revert any policy decision made in step\\xa012 for the purpose of CS to PS SRVCC procedures.\\n\\nNOTE\\xa04:\\tWhere the bearer contexts are suspended depends on if the CS call was triggered by SRVCC from E-UTRAN or from CS procedures while the UE was attached to 2G/3G. If the CS call was triggered by SRVCC from E-UTRAN the bearers are suspended in an MME, and step\\xa04 is sent to the old MME only in the case of MME change, or if the CS call was triggered while UE was in 2G/3G, the bearers are suspended in the old SGSN.
